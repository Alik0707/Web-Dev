  <h1>The Loving Soul</h1>

  <p>
    A speechless tongue, yet love can speak<br>
    Seen by the eyes, felt deep inside<br>
    Love is a force so mysterious<br>
    To feel it is a sweet sorrow<br>

    Burning with fire through day and night<br>
    I lost myself, forgot my name<br>
    This feeling rose to something high<br>
    Love blazing like an endless flame<br>

    Loving eyes can’t see the pain<br>
    Loving words can shake the soul<br>
    Wandering through the world of men<br>
    Just don’t let your spirit fall<br>

    My eyes are open, my chest is full<br>
    My gaze is new, my soul alive<br>
    Is it fortune or a soul-stealer?<br>
    A fated person crossed my life<br>

    My thoughtful mind gives quiet advice<br>
    Without them, this world feels blind<br>
    My breath grows tight, my heart beats fast<br>
    I felt this feeling at last<br>
    Sweet as honey, deep and true<br>
