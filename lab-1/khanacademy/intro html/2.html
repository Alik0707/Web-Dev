      Nobody’s born smart. We all start at <strong>0</strong>. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
      Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
      There was a time when <strong>Einstein</strong> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
      And <strong>Shakespeare</strong> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
      Thankfully, we are <em>born to learn</em>.<br>
      Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
      <em>Frustrating.</em> <em>Confusing.</em> <em>Trying.</em> <em>Struggling.</em><br>
      Until one day, you walk.<br>
      One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
      Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
      <strong>Failing is just another word for growing.</strong> And you keep going.<br>
      <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
      It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
      You just don’t get it, <em>yet</em>.<br>
      Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
      are built on basic ideas that <strong>anyone, anywhere</strong> can understand.<br>
      Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      You only have to know one thing:<br>
      <strong><em>You can learn anything.</em></strong>
